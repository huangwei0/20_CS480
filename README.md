Student Learning Outcomes
At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
-Describe characteristics common to a wide variety of translators.
-Explain the phases of a compiler.
-Explain the difference between the compile time and run time representation of a program, and the structures appropriate to each.
-Use regular expressions and context free languages to define a language syntax.
-Perform manipulations on a grammar for a simple context-free language (for example, removal of recursion, factoring, making a grammar LL(1)).
-Implement a lexical analyzer to recognize tokens defined by regular expressions.
-Implement a parser, using either top-down or bottom-up techniques.
-Generate working target language for simple programming constructs.
